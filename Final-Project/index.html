                <h1>Personality</h1>
                <p>Frieren has an easy-going personality; however, her aloof attitude makes her a mystery to her peers,
                    with
                    Heiter
                    commenting that they as Humans cannot perceive an Elf's feelings. As an Elf that has lived for at
                    least
                    a
                    millennium,
                    she has a poor sense of time that manifests in a bad habit of being unable to get up in the morning,
                    along
                    with a deeper
                    inability to comprehend how time passes for Humans. This is, in part, a reason for Frieren's aloof
                    attitude,
                    since she
                    sees large lengths of time as too brief for her to form meaningful connections. For instance, she
                    thought of
                    a ten-year
                    journey with her comrades as short and believed she knew nothing about the Hero Himmel even up until
                    his
                    passing.
                    However, following Himmel's funeral, she made the decision to get to know Humans better.</p>
                <div></div>
                <p>Although she is generally stoic, carefree, and often lacks tact, Frieren also has things she is
                    emotionally
                    sensitive
                    to. She was embarrassed when others discovered her mana detection is interrupted for a fraction of a
                    second
                    when a spell
                    is cast, a common error for apprentice mages that she hasn't been able to overcome. She is sensitive
                    to
                    people calling
                    her old and held a grudge against Stark for doing so twice. When she is upset, she is capable of
                    throwing a
                    tantrum that
                    can result in her crying for upwards of three days, scaring the other members of the Hero's Party.
                    It
                    also
                    implied that
                    she is somewhat insecure about her body, as she occasionally shows hints of jealousy over the size
                    of
                    Fern's
                    bust.</p>

                <h1>Appearance</h1>
                <p>
                    Frieren is a petite, female Elf with green eyes and long white hair tied into two pigtails. Like all
                    Elves,
                    she has
                    large, pointed ears. </p>
                <p>She wears a striped black and white shirt, along with a white jacket with gold embellishments tucked
                    into
                    a
                    matching
                    skirt with a black belt. Over her jacket, she wears a short white and gold cape with a high collar.
                    She
                    also
                    wears black
                    tights and brown boots, and a pair of gold and red earrings. </p>
                <p>In the past, she let her hair down and wore a simple, white dress.</p>

                    <ul>
                        <h1>Abilities</h1>
                        <li><b>Immense mana output:</b> Frieren's unrestrained mana output is incredibly high. She is
                            shown
                            to
                            have considerably more mana
                            than even Aura, a five-hundred year-old demon and one of the Seven Sages of Destruction.
                            Frieren's
                            overall mana output
                            is noted to be comparable to Serie's restrained output.</li>
                        <p></p>
                        <li><b>Mana concealment:</b> Trained by her mentor, Flamme, Frieren has mastered the art of
                            concealing
                            her mana, and she uses it as
                            a deception strategy against demons. Her skill in concealment is exceptional, and she has
                            practiced
                            limiting her mana
                            for so long that even experienced mages, such as Aura[7] and Falsch[8], cannot detect
                            instability in
                            her mana. Only a
                            few mages have seen through her restriction, the most notable being the Demon King, who saw
                            through
                            her in an instant.
                            She can even suppress her mana enough to avoid detection by a Stille, but only while staying
                            still.
                        </li>
                        <p></p>
                        <li><b>Analytical ability:</b> Frieren is highly adept at analyzing magics and countering them.
                            This
                            applies even to magic used by
                            the Seven Sages of Destruction which are said to defy all intelligence and reason. She has
                            analyzed
                            and countered the
                            magic used by two of the Sages of Destruction: Aura the Guillotine and Macht of the Golden
                            Land.
                            Along with the Hero
                            Party, she was also able to break through the impenetrable barrier of Böse the Immortal.

                    <ul>
                        <h1>Spells</h1>
                        <li><b>Offensive magic: Zoltraak:</b> A simple spell that shoots either a large blast or
                            multiple
                            smaller blasts of concentrated
                            mana. Frieren contributed to the research of this magic, modifying it from Qual's Human
                            Killing
                            Magic to Demon Killing
                            Magic. Due to the novelty of the spell, Frieren is unable to react to it immediately and
                            instinctively and thus has a
                            slightly delayed reaction when defending against it.</li>
                        <p></p>
                        <li><b>Defensive magic:</b> Like most modern mages, Frieren is capable of casting defensive
                            magic in
                            the
                            form of a hexagonal
                            protective barriers that can defend specific locations or encircle the caster. This defense
                            spell is
                            mainly used against
                            offensive magic like Zoltraak.</li>
                        <p></p>
                        <li><b>Dispelling magic:</b> Frieren is capable of analyzing an opponent's spell and cancel out
                            the
                            effects of the spell. Her staff
                            glows golden while casting the dispelling magic. It is first seen in use against Aura's
                            undead
                            army,
                            where Frieren frees
                            corpses from Aura's Auserlese.</li>
                        <p></p>
                        <li><b>Spell to produce a field of flowers:</b> Frieren was taught her mentor's favorite magic,
                            magic to
                            produce a beautiful field
                            of flowers, which holds sentimental value to her. Frieren is able to choose what flowers
                            grow as
                            long as she has seen
                            the flower before. As per Flamme's last wishes, she grows a field of flowers around her
                            master's
                            grave with the spell
                            and avoids using the spell due to it bringing up memories of her.</li>
                        <p></p>
                        <li><b>Spell that shuts the door of a treasure vault at the risk of your life:</b> A binding
                            spell
                            that
                            is considered top-rated in
                            folk magic, which Frieren's Spiegel clone uses to seal the entrance of the Spiegel's main
                            body
                            and a
                            treasure vault. The
                            seal only break upon the caster's death.</li>
                        <p></p>
                        <li><b>Destructive Lightning:</b> Judradjim: Frieren casts multiple bolts of lightning from her
                            staff
                            directed towards the target.
                            She is first shown using this during the battle against her Spiegel clone.</li>
                        <p></p>
                        <li><b>Hellfire Summoning:</b> Vollzanbel: Frieren creates a large blast of fire in front of
                            herself,
                            enveloping the
                            battlefield. It can melt anything such as a falling column when Frieren and her clone used
                            it at
                            the
                            same time.</li>
                        <p></p>
                        <li><b>"The Height of Magic":</b> An offensive attack that Frieren's clone uses as a last
                            resort.
                            Mana
                            cannot be sensed when the
                            attack is used, and targets of the attack are unable to recognize it as a spell.[16] It
