        <h2>About domestic cats</h2>
        <p>They are often called <i>house cats</i> when kept as indoor pets or simply cats when there is no need to
            distinguish them
            from
            other felids and felines. They are often valued by humans for <b>companionship.</b></p>

        <h1>The lions</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>Present in Africa and India, the lion typically inhabits grasslands and savannahs, but is absent in dense
            forests.
            It is
            usually more diurnal than other big cats, but when persecuted adapts to being active at night and at
            twilight. A
            lion
            pride consists of a few adult males, related females and cubs. Prides vary in size and composition from
            three to
            20
            adult lions, depending on habitat and prey availability. Females cooperate when hunting and prey mostly on
            large
            ungulates, including antelope, deer, buffalo, zebra and even giraffe.</p>
